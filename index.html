At Epicodus - the vocational school for programmer - we train our students in high-demand programming skills, and then help them find full time employment as software developers. Additionally, we place a high value on student life and experience. In order to focus on student learning and interaction, we use a completely ‘flipped’ classroom by "pair programming".</p><br><p>But before we tell you more information about the school, allow us to get to know you by completing these simple questions.
